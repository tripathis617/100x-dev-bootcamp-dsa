Biweekly Contest - II
A. Result Day
time limit per test1 second
memory limit per test256 megabytes
It's the result day and you are given the marks of N
 students in a class and the passing marks.

A student is considered Pass if their marks are greater than or equal to the passing marks. Otherwise, the student is considered Fail.

Your task is to count how many students passed and how many failed.

Input
First line contains integer N
 (1≤N≤105)
 — number of students.
Second line contains N
 integers Ai
 (0≤Ai≤100)
 — marks of students.
Third line contains integer P
 (0≤P≤100)
 — passing marks.
Output
Print exactly two lines:


Pass: X
Fail: Y
where:

X
 = number of students who passed
Y
 = number of students who failed
Example

45 60 30 80 50
50
OutputCopy
Pass: 3
Fail: 2

B. Fastest Runner
time limit per test1 second
memory limit per test256 megabytes
In an Olympic race, there are N
 runners numbered from 1
 to N
.

You are given the time taken by each runner to complete the race.

The runner with the minimum time is considered the fastest.

If multiple runners have the same fastest time, choose the runner with the larger ID.

Input
First line contains integer N
 (1≤N≤105)
.

Second line contains N
 integers T1,T2,…,TN
 where
1≤Ti≤109
represents the time taken by the i
-th runner.

Output
Print a single integer — the ID of the fastest runner.

Example
InputCopy
5
12 9 15 9 10
OutputCopy
4
Note
There are (5) runners with the following completion times:

[12, 9, 15, 9, 10]

The minimum time taken is (9).

This time occurs for two runners:

Runner (2)
Runner (4)
Since multiple runners have the same fastest time, we choose the runner with the larger ID.

Hence, the answer is:

4

E. Beautiful Array
time limit per test1 second
memory limit per test256 megabytes
An array is said to be beautiful if all its elements are equal.

Given an array of integers, determine whether the array is beautiful or not.

Input
First line contains an integer N
 (1≤N≤105)
 — size of the array.

Second line contains N
 integers Ai
 (−109≤Ai≤109)
.

Output
Print YES if the array is beautiful, otherwise print NO.

Examples

YES

F. Special Factors
time limit per test1 second
memory limit per test256 megabytes
Given an integer N
, print all special factors∗
 of N
 in increasing order.

A factor is called special if its last digit is 2
 or 7
 (i.e., dmod10∈{2,7}
).

∗
A positive integer d
 is a factor of N
 if Nmodd=0
.

Input
The only line contains an integer N
 (1≤N≤106
).

Output
Print all special factors of N
 in increasing order, separated by spaces. If N
 has no special factors, print -1.

G. RCB wins again
time limit per test1 s.
memory limit per test256 MB
After winning the IPL, RCB is posing for a victory photo. But instead of standing in the usual order, the captain wants a formation that feels perfectly symmetric.

The arrangement is defined as follows:

Start from the two middle players.
Then move one step outward on both sides.
Print the next outward pair.
Continue until all players are included.
You must print the players in this order:

middle-left, middle-right, then expanding outward by alternating left and right, until the entire array is covered.

Input
An even integer N
 (2≤N≤100000)
.
A line containing N
 space-separated integers a0,a1,…,aN−1
, where −109≤ai≤109
.
Output
Print the rearranged sequence in one line, space-separated.

Example
InputCopy
6
10 20 30 40 50 60
OutputCopy
30 40 20 50 10 60
Explanation

Since N
 is even, the two middle players are:

middle-left = a2=30
middle-right = a3=40
These two are printed first.

Then we move outward step by step:

First step outward:
left side: a1=20
right side: a4=50

Second step outward:
left side: a0=10
right side: a5=60
Putting them together in order: [ 30 40 20 50 10 60 ]

H. Almost Primes
time limit per test1 second
memory limit per test256 megabytes
A prime number is a number that has exactly 2
 divisors∗
: 1
 and the number itself.

A number x
 is called almost prime if it has at most 4
 positive divisors.

Given an integer N
, print all almost prime numbers in the range [1,N]
 in increasing order.

∗
A positive integer d
 is a divisor of x
 if d∣x
, i.e., x
 is divisible by d
 with remainder 0
.

Input
The only line contains an integer N
 (1≤N≤5000
).

Output
Print all integers x
 such that 1≤x≤N
 and x
 has at most 4
 positive divisors. Print them in increasing order, separated by single spaces.

Example
InputCopy
12
OutputCopy
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
Note
For N=12
, the number 12
 is not almost prime because it has 6
 positive divisors: 1,2,3,4,6,12
.


I. Unique Elements
time limit per test1 second
memory limit per test256 megabytes
You are given an array of integers.

Your task is to print all elements that occur exactly once in the array, in the same order as they appear in the input.

Input

 (1≤N≤5000
), the number of elements in the array.

The second line contains N
 integers a1,a2,…,aN
 (−109≤ai≤109
).

Output
Print all elements that occur exactly once in the array, in the same order as the input, separated by single spaces.

If no such element exists, print an empty line.
