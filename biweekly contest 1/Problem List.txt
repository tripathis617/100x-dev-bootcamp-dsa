Biweekly Contest - I
A. Hello Codeforces
time limit per test1 s.
memory limit per test256 MB
You are given an integer N
. Print the message Hello Codeforces exactly N
 times.

Along with the message, also print the line number starting from 1
.

Each message must be printed on a new line.

Input
The only line contains an integer N
 (1≤N≤1000
).

Output
Print N
 lines. The i
-th line should be:

Hello Codeforces i
where i
 starts from 1
.
Example

3
OutputCopy
Hello Codeforces 1
Hello Codeforces 2
Hello Codeforces 3
B. Is Vowel?
time limit per test1 second
memory limit per test256 megabytes
You are given a lowercase English letter.

Your task is to determine whether the given character is a vowel or not.

Vowels are:
{a,e,i,o,u}

Input
The only line contains a single lowercase English letter.

Output
Print YES if the character is a vowel, otherwise print NO.

Examples
InputCopy
a
OutputCopy
YES
InputCopy
b
OutputCopy
NO

C. Second Last Digit
time limit per test1 second
memory limit per test256 megabytes
You are given an integer N
.

Your task is to print the second last digit of N
.

Input
The only line contains an integer N
 (10≤N≤105
).

Output
Print a single digit — the second last digit of N
.

Examples
InputCopy
42
OutputCopy
4
InputCopy
10
OutputCopy
1

D. Leap Year
time limit per test1 second
memory limit per test256 megabytes
To check whether a year is a leap year, follow these rules:

First check if the year is divisible by 100
. If it is, then it must also be divisible by 400
 to be a leap year.
If the year is not divisible by 100
, then it is a leap year if it is divisible by 4
.
You are given a year Y
. Determine whether it is a leap year or not.

Input
The only line contains an integer Y
 (1600≤Y≤9000
).

Output
Print Yes if the year is a leap year, otherwise print No.

Examples
InputCopy
2000
OutputCopy
Yes
InputCopy
2004
OutputCopy
Yes
InputCopy
2100
OutputCopy
No

E. Count Good Numbers
time limit per test1 second
memory limit per test256 megabytes
You are given an integer N
 and then N
 integers.

Count how many of these numbers are good.

A number x
 is said to be good if:

x
 is a factor of 18
 (i.e., 18modx=0
), or
x
 is a multiple of 45
 (i.e., xmod45=0
).
Input
The first line contains an integer N
 (1≤N≤105
).

The second line contains N
 integers x1,x2,…,xN
 (0≤xi≤109
).

Output
Print a single integer: the number of good integers among the N
 given numbers.

Example
InputCopy
8
1 2 3 4 5 6 9 90
OutputCopy
6
Note
For x=0
, it cannot be a factor of 18
 (division by zero is undefined), but it is a multiple of 45
 because 0mod45=0
.


F. FizzBuzz
time limit per test1 second
memory limit per test256 megabytes
You are given an integer N
.

Print the numbers from 1
 to N
 following the rules below:

If the number is divisible by 3
, print Fizz.
If the number is divisible by 5
, print Buzz.
If the number is divisible by both 3
 and 5
, print FizzBuzz.
Otherwise, print the number itself.
Each output should be printed on a new line.

Input
The only line contains an integer N
 (1≤N≤105
).

Output
Print N
 lines according to the rules above.

Example
InputCopy

 (0≤N≤1018
).

Output
Print a single integer — the count of zeros in N
.

Examples
InputCopy
102030
OutputCopy
3
InputCopy
0
OutputCopy
1
H. Empty Rectangle
