Functions
A. Hello Functions
time limit per test1 second
memory limit per test256 megabytes
You are given an integer N
.

Write a function that takes N
 as a parameter and prints the string I am learning functions exactly N
 times, each on a new line.

Input
The only line contains an integer N
 (1≤N≤1000
).

Output
Print N
 lines. Each line must be exactly:

I am learning functions
Example
InputCopy
3
OutputCopy
I am learning functions
I am learning functions
I am learning functions

B. Print Factors - I
time limit per test1 second
memory limit per test256 megabytes
You are given an integer N
.

Write a function that prints all factors∗
 of N
 in increasing order.

∗
A positive integer d
 is called a divisor (factor) of N
 if Nmodd=0
.

Input
The only line contains an integer N
 (1≤N≤105
).

Output
Print all factors of N
 in increasing order, separated by single spaces.

Example
InputCopy
12
OutputCopy
1 2 3 4 6 12

C. Print Factors - II
time limit per test1 second
memory limit per test256 megabytes
You are given an integer N
.

Write a function that prints all factors∗
 of N
 in decreasing order.

∗
A positive integer d
 is called a divisor (factor) of N
 if Nmodd=0
.

Input
The only line contains an integer N
 (1≤N≤105
).

Output
Print all factors of N
 in decreasing order, separated by single spaces.

Example
InputCopy
12
OutputCopy
12 6 4 3 2 1

D. Check Prime
time limit per test1 second
memory limit per test256 megabytes
You are given an integer N
.

Write a function that checks whether N
 is a prime number.

Print Prime if N
 is prime, otherwise print Not Prime.

Input
The only line contains an integer N
 (1≤N≤105
).

Output
Print Prime or Not Prime.

Examples
InputCopy
17
OutputCopy
Prime
InputCopy
4
OutputCopy
Not Prime

E. Factorial
time limit per test1 second
memory limit per test256 megabytes
You are given an integer N
.

Find the factorial of N
 by writing a function that takes N
 as a parameter and returns N!
, where:
N!=1×2×3×⋯×N

Input
The first line contains an integer N
 (0≤N≤20
).

Output
Print the value of N!
.

Examples
InputCopy
5
OutputCopy
120
InputCopy
7
OutputCopy
5040
Note
By definition, 0!=1
.
The constraint N≤20
 ensures the answer fits in a 64-bit integer.

F. nCr

memory limit per test256 megabytes
You are given two integers n
 and r
.

Write a function to compute the binomial coefficient:
(nr)=n!r!(n−r)!

Input
The only line contains two integers n
 and r
 (0≤r≤n≤10
).

Output
Print the value of (nr)
.

Examples
InputCopy
5 2
OutputCopy
10
InputCopy
10 0
OutputCopy
1

G. Print Primes from 1 to N
time limit per test1 second
memory limit per test256 megabytes
You are given an integer N
.

Print all prime numbers from 1
 to N
 in increasing order by writing a function that takes N
 as a parameter and prints the required primes.

Input
The only line contains an integer N
 (1≤N≤103
).

Output
Print all prime numbers from 1
 to N
 in increasing order, separated by single spaces.

If there is no prime number in the range, print nothing.

Example
InputCopy
10
OutputCopy
2 3 5 7

H. Count Zeros
time limit per test1 s.
memory limit per test256 MB
You are given a non-negative integer N
.

Find the number of digits equal to 0 in the decimal representation of N
 by writing a function that takes N
 as a parameter and returns the count of zero digits.

Input
The only line contains an integer N
 (0≤N≤1018
).

Output
Print a single integer — the count of zeros in N
.

Examples
InputCopy
102030
OutputCopy
3
InputCopy
0
OutputCopy
1
