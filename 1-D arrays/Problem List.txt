Q. Count Quadraplets
time limit per test1 second
memory limit per test256 megabytes
You are given an array A
 of length n
 and an integer x
 (the target). Your task is to count the number of quadruplets (i,j,k,l)
 such that:

A[i]−2∗A[j]+3∗A[k]−4∗A[l]=x,

where 0<i<j<k<l<n
.

Input
The first line contains two integers n
 and x
 (1≤n≤100
, |x|≤106
).

The second line contains n
 integers A1,A2,…,An
 (|Ai|≤1000
).

Output
Print a single integer, the number of quadruplets (i,j,k,l)
 that satisfy the given condition.

Examples
InputCopy
4 -2
3 2 1 1
OutputCopy
1
InputCopy
8 -10
1 2 3 4 5 6 5 6
OutputCopy
5
Note
For the 2nd Example, The valid quadruplets (i,j,k,l)
 (1-indexed) are:

[ (1,3,5,7):   1 - 2 * 3 + 3 * 5 - 4 * 5 = -10 ]

[ (1,3,5,8):   1 - 2 * 3 + 3 * 5 - 4 * 6 = -10 ]

[ (1,3,7,8):   1 - 2 * 3 + 3 * 7 - 4 * 6 = -10 ]

[ (2,3,6,7):   2 - 2 * 3 + 3 * 6 - 4 * 5 = -10 ]

[ (2,3,6,8):   2 - 2 * 3 + 3 * 6 - 4 * 6 = -10 ]

So the answer is 5
.

Two quadruplets are considered different if they have at least one different index among them.
